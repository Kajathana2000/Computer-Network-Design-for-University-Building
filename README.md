# University Computer Network Design Project üåêüè¢

This project focuses on designing a computer network for the new **IT Centre** and **Department Building** at the university. The goal is to provide a reliable, secure, and well-structured network with optimal use of IP addresses. The project includes subnetting, VLANs, Wi-Fi configurations, and router and switch setup.

## üìã Network Requirements

1. **Network Isolation:**  
   - Staff room computers are isolated from other department rooms and labs for security.  
   - Department office computers are isolated from staff rooms, labs, and other spaces.

2. **Printer Access Restrictions:**  
   - IT Centre printers are accessible only by IT Centre staff.  
   - Department office printer is accessible only by department staff.

3. **Administrator Access Control:**  
   - All network nodes are only accessible by the administrator.

## üõ†Ô∏è Network Setup and Configuration

### 1. **Subnetting Plan**
The given IP address range is `10.20.0.0/16`. Subnets and VLANs will be created based on logical groups to isolate different sections of the network for security and performance.

- **IT Centre:**  
  - VLAN 10: Director and Staff Offices  
  - VLAN 20: Technical Officers and Labs  
  - VLAN 30: Wi-Fi and Meeting Rooms  

- **Department Block:**  
  - VLAN 40: Lecture Halls  
  - VLAN 50: Staff Rooms  
  - VLAN 60: Labs (Network, Microprocessor, CV/ML Labs)  
  - VLAN 70: Department Office and Meeting Room  

### 2. **Router and Switch Configuration**
Below are the general steps to configure the router and switches:

#### Router Configuration Example:
```bash
# Assign IP address to interfaces
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
  ip address 10.20.1.1 255.255.255.0
  no shutdown

# Enable routing between VLANs
ip routing

# Configure static routes if needed
ip route 10.20.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.20.1.2

#### **Switch Configuration Example:**
vlan 10
  name Director_Staff

interface GigabitEthernet0/2
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan 10
